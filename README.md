HYBRID ENCRYPTION
Safety has become a very important part of modern life. Data security is the most mandatory security of all. The data on our system is exposed to high potential risks. Due to different safety reasons we use different methods. . While most web- based applications require data security we need to focus on developing better algorithms for the purpose of encryption of the data to make it moresecure. Our aim in this project is to develop a design and implementation of a much simplified and efficient hybrid algorithm based on the Data Encryption Standard (DES),AES and blowfish algorithm which is very similar, but works on in a different way. Our Hybrid algorithm will provide more security to the storage systems.

1.METHODOLOGY:-
As we discussed above that data security is very important and the current algorithms can be under attack and data can be decrypted by the attacker for malicious use.Thus we have presented our hybrid algorithm which will be much more secured as well as perform better than the current in use algorithms.Instead of using one single algorithm to protect userâ€™s data we have proposed a hybrid encryption system in which we will be using the three most popular encrypting algorithms:
1.DES (Data Encryption Standard)
2.AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
3.Blowfish Algorithm
